# Equatoria Idle — Technical Decisions

## Internal Render Resolution

**Decision**: Render the game canvas at 320px internal width, with height calculated from container aspect ratio.

**Rationale**: 320px provides a good balance between the retro-pixel aesthetic and readability of mathematical expressions. CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` handles the upscaling cleanly. This keeps particle counts and drawing operations low on mobile.

## Math Notation Rendering

**Decision**: Use structured `EquationTermView` objects rendered directly on canvas via `fillText`.

**Rationale**: For the current complexity level (additive terms with numbers), canvas text rendering is sufficient and fast. The view model is structured as typed objects rather than raw strings, making it straightforward to evolve toward an expression tree model (power notation, functions, nested expressions) as complexity grows.

**Future**: When expressions become deeply nested, consider migrating to a proper expression tree with layout algorithms (like TeX-style box model), or integrate a lightweight math rendering library.

## Big Number Strategy

**Decision**: Use native JavaScript `number` type for now, with `formatNumber()` helper for display.

**Rationale**: Early-game values stay well within safe integer range. The formatting utility supports K/M/B/T suffixes. When late-game scaling requires it, introduce a big-number library or logarithmic helper layer. The authoritative state uses `number` everywhere, making it a clean swap point.

## Particle Authority Model

**Decision**: Particles are purely visual — they do not represent authoritative economic state.

**Rationale**: Motes are added to `ResourceState` immediately on tap. Particles are cosmetic feedback. This avoids coupling visual performance to economic correctness, simplifies save/load (no need to persist particles), and allows particle count caps without affecting gameplay.

## Save Format Strategy

**Decision**: JSON in `localStorage` with a `version` field. On version mismatch, start fresh.

**Rationale**: Simple and sufficient for early development. The version field enables future migration logic. The save structure mirrors game state closely for easy serialization.

**Future**: Add migration functions when the save format changes.

## Canvas / UI Layering

**Decision**: Single low-resolution canvas for game visuals, separate DOM layer for UI panels and tab bar.

**Rationale**: The canvas handles the pixel-art aesthetic (equation, particles, background). DOM handles readable text UI (upgrade buttons, resource lists, settings). This separation keeps each layer optimized for its purpose.

## Forge System

**Decision**: Deferred. The forge system will be implemented from a separate repository.

**Rationale**: Keeps the initial implementation focused on equation progression and particle feedback. The forge integration point is the particle system (particles drawn toward forge) and resource state (raw → refined motes).

## Cost Scaling Formula

**Decision**: `cost = baseCost × scaleFactor^level` with per-upgrade base costs and scale factors.

**Rationale**: Standard idle game exponential scaling. Each upgrade definition specifies its own base cost and scale factor, allowing fine-grained balance tuning without code changes.

## Auto-Tap System

**Decision**: Auto-tap is a purchasable upgrade with decreasing interval per level, hard-floored at 200ms.

**Rationale**: Gives players a meaningful upgrade path. The hard floor prevents degenerate rapid tapping. The auto-tap triggers the same `tapEquation()` function as manual taps, keeping the code path unified.
