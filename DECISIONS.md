# Equatoria Idle — Technical Decisions

## Internal Render Resolution

**Decision**: Render the game canvas at 320px internal width, with height calculated from container aspect ratio.

**Rationale**: 320px provides a good balance between the retro-pixel aesthetic and readability of mathematical expressions. CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` handles the upscaling cleanly. This keeps particle counts and drawing operations low on mobile.

## Math Notation Rendering

**Decision**: Use structured `EquationTermView` objects rendered directly on canvas via `fillText`.

**Rationale**: For the current complexity level (additive terms with numbers), canvas text rendering is sufficient and fast. The view model is structured as typed objects rather than raw strings, making it straightforward to evolve toward an expression tree model (power notation, functions, nested expressions) as complexity grows.

**Future**: When expressions become deeply nested, consider migrating to a proper expression tree with layout algorithms (like TeX-style box model), or integrate a lightweight math rendering library.

## Big Number Strategy

**Decision**: Use native JavaScript `number` type for now, with `formatNumber()` helper for display.

**Rationale**: Early-game values stay well within safe integer range. The formatting utility supports K/M/B/T suffixes. When late-game scaling requires it, introduce a big-number library or logarithmic helper layer. The authoritative state uses `number` everywhere, making it a clean swap point.

## Particle Authority Model

**Decision**: Particles are purely visual — they do not represent authoritative economic state.

**Rationale**: Motes are added to `ResourceState` immediately on tap. Particles are cosmetic feedback. This avoids coupling visual performance to economic correctness, simplifies save/load (no need to persist particles), and allows particle count caps without affecting gameplay.

## Save Format Strategy

**Decision**: JSON in `localStorage` with a `version` field. On version mismatch, start fresh.

**Rationale**: Simple and sufficient for early development. The version field enables future migration logic. The save structure mirrors game state closely for easy serialization.

**Future**: Add migration functions when the save format changes.

## Canvas / UI Layering

**Decision**: Single low-resolution canvas for game visuals, separate DOM layer for UI panels and tab bar.

**Rationale**: The canvas handles the pixel-art aesthetic (equation, particles, background). DOM handles readable text UI (upgrade buttons, resource lists, settings). This separation keeps each layer optimized for its purpose.

## Forge System

**Decision**: Forge crunch state lives in `GameState` (sim layer), with physics and rendering separated into `sim/forge/` and `render/forge/`.

**Rationale**: The forge crunch timer and progress are authoritative game state and must be serializable. Physics logic (`checkForgeCrunch`, `updateForgeCrunch`) is pure and takes the state as a parameter. Rendering reads crunch state but never mutates it directly.

**Forge crunch flow**: Eligible particles (medium+, with valid output tier) near the forge center start a `FORGE_VALID_WAIT_TIME_MS` countdown. When it expires, a `FORGE_CRUNCH_DURATION_MS` animation plays, consuming the particles and producing next-tier outputs. The forge spins up progressively as the timer counts down and spins down after completion.

## Particle Size Tier System

**Decision**: Four particle size tiers (small=0, medium=1, large=2, extra-large=3), with per-size modifiers for velocity, force, and visual scale.

**Rationale**: Merging 100 small particles produces 1 medium, providing a natural compression mechanic. Medium/large/extra-large particles are attracted to the forge for crunch. The `SizeIndex` type union (0|1|2|3) provides type-safe size arithmetic.

## Generator Ring Layout

**Decision**: Generators are arranged in a ring centered on the equation, with radius proportional to `min(canvasWidth, canvasHeight) * 0.35`. Angles are evenly distributed.

**Rationale**: Ring layout naturally accommodates 1–9 tiers without overlap. The radius fraction was chosen to keep generators visible without crowding the equation display. Positions are recomputed on resize and tier unlock.

## Particle Drag Interaction

**Decision**: Pointer events on the canvas can grab nearby particles. Dragged particles follow the pointer; releasing with velocity imparts momentum.

**Rationale**: Gives players a tactile interaction with the simulation that doesn't affect economic state. The interaction radius scales with canvas size for consistent mobile feel. Stationary releases slow particles to minimum velocity to avoid leaving dead particles.

## Particle Physics Model

**Decision**: Frame-rate-normalized physics using `deltaRatio = deltaMs / (1000/60)`. All forces and velocities are expressed in units-per-frame at 60fps and scaled by `clampedDelta`.

**Rationale**: Keeps physics intuitive to tune (constants feel like "per frame at 60fps") while remaining stable at lower frame rates. Delta is clamped to [0.01, 3] to prevent tunneling and wild behaviour after tab switches.


## Cost Scaling Formula

**Decision**: `cost = baseCost × scaleFactor^level` with per-upgrade base costs and scale factors.

**Rationale**: Standard idle game exponential scaling. Each upgrade definition specifies its own base cost and scale factor, allowing fine-grained balance tuning without code changes.

## Auto-Tap System

**Decision**: Auto-tap is a purchasable upgrade with decreasing interval per level, hard-floored at 200ms.

**Rationale**: Gives players a meaningful upgrade path. The hard floor prevents degenerate rapid tapping. The auto-tap triggers the same `tapEquation()` function as manual taps, keeping the code path unified.
